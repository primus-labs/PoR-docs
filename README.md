# Proof-of-Reserves Product Introduction

## Overview

Primus enables verifiable transparency over institutional reserves through a Data Verification and Computation (DVC) architecture. By combining **zkTLS** for authenticated off-chain data retrieval with **zkVM/TEE** for verifiable computation, Primus delivers a mature, ready-to-use **Proof-of-Reserves** (PoR) solution. 

Institutions can securely aggregate and verify both on-chain and off-chain reserves, and continuously present their real-time financial positions with cryptographic certainty.


## What PoR Solution Solves

| **Challenge**                                                | **Primus Solution**                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lack of trust in off-chain assets or custodian balances      | zkTLS attestation ensures the authenticity and provenance of off-chain data, while the institution retains full ownership and control over all private credentials. |
| Asset disclosure updates are infrequent                      | Automated, high-frequency PoR refreshing. Verification intervals can be customized based on operational requirements. |
| Exposing account-level data raises privacy concerns          | zkVM enables privacy-preserving asset aggregation with selective disclosure. |
| No unified view of total reserves across on-chain and off-chain sources | Primus provides a consolidated, verifiable reserves overview by combining both on-chain and off-chain proofs into a single aggregated total. |



## Product Highlights

**1. Easy to use and integrate**

Primus provides an intuitive **PoR Admin Console** that allows institutions to configure the assets they want to verify—both on-chain and off-chain—in a simple and flexible way. Within the console, users can create projects to configure data sources, manage verification scope, set disclosure preferences, and define exactly what information will be publicly visible.

Each institution also receives a dedicated **public Explorer page** automatically generated by Primus. This page displays the verified reserves according to the settings defined in the Admin Console, providing end users with a transparent and continuously updated view of the asset holdings.

**2. One integration covers all external integrations and operational costs**

Primus handles all the technical complexity behind the PoR product. With a single integration, institutions gain access to all supported on-chain networks, off-chain data sources, and verification infrastructure—without needing to negotiate or maintain multiple external partnerships or bear additional integration costs.

Primus manages the entire pipeline, including API integrations, cryptographic verification, secure computation, node infrastructure, and ongoing operational overhead. This dramatically reduces engineering workload, compliance coordination, long-term maintenance, and external vendor expenses for institutions.


## Key Workflows

Here is the workflow for creating and publishing your Proof-of-Reserves:

**Step1. Create a new project in the Admin Console**

Define your organization identity and configure a showcase URL under the unified domain format 'por.primuslabs.xyz/....'. Each project can specify its own unique path.

**Step 2. Set up your reserve sources and disclose preferences**

In this step, you can add the on-chain and off-chain assets you want to include in your Proof-of-Reserves.

For on-chain reserves, you can manage wallet addresses and token disclosure scopes. Each wallet requires a one-time micro-transaction challenge to verify ownership. 

For off-chain reserves, Primus will provide a customized PoR program based on your data requirements.

You can also optionally configure supply details if you wish to show the reserve-backing ratio, and define alert thresholds to receive email notifications when reserves fall below your desired conditions.

**Step 3. Preview the Explorer page** directly within the Admin Console.

**Step 4. Publish the project** to share your showcase URL with users, auditors, or partners.



## Pricing

Primus PoR product offers a simple and transparent pricing model.

We provide a **7-day free publishing period**, allowing you to create and publish a PoR project at no cost. After the 7-day trial ends, continued public hosting requires a **monthly subscription**.

You can subscribe directly in the Admin Console or contact our team for assistance.



## Technical Highlights

Primus enables privacy-preserving verification of off-chain reserves by combining zkTLS, TEE, and zkVM-based verifiable computation on a decentralized proving network.

**zkTLS for Authentic Off-Chain Data**

A custom PoR program runs in your own environment, using zkTLS to retrieve real-time balances from sources such as CEX accounts. zkTLS proves the data comes from the legitimate API endpoint over a trusted TLS session—without exposing API keys or raw account details.

**TEE for Secure Data Handling**

Retrieved data is processed inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), ensuring confidentiality during computation and establishing a secure channel to the proving network.

**zkVM for Verifiable Aggregation**

Through the TEE, committed data is sent to a zkVM network for aggregation and final computation. A zero-knowledge proof guarantees that the disclosed reserve value is correctly derived from authentic balances, while all sensitive information remains private.
