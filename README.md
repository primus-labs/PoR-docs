# Proof-of-Reserves Product Introduction

## Overview

Primus enables verifiable transparency over institutional reserves through a Data Verification and Computation (DVC) architecture. By combining **zkTLS** for authenticated off-chain data retrieval with **zkVM/TEE** for verifiable computation, Primus delivers a mature, ready-to-use **Proof-of-Reserves** (PoR) solution. 

Institutions can securely aggregate and verify both on-chain and off-chain reserves, and continuously present their real-time financial positions with cryptographic certainty.



## What PoR Solution Solves

| **Challenge**                                                | **Primus Solution**                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lack of trust in off-chain assets or custodian balances      | zkTLS attestation ensures the authenticity and provenance of off-chain data, while the institution retains full ownership and control over all private credentials. |
| Asset disclosure updates are infrequent                      | Automated, high-frequency PoR refreshing. Verification intervals can be customized based on operational requirements. |
| Exposing account-level data raises privacy concerns          | zkVM enables privacy-preserving asset aggregation with selective disclosure. |
| No unified view of total reserves across on-chain and off-chain sources | Primus provides a consolidated, verifiable reserves overview by combining both on-chain and off-chain proofs into a single aggregated total. |



## How it Works

Primus provides an intuitive **PoR Admin Console** that allows institutions to configure the assets they want to verify—both on-chain and off-chain—in a simple and flexible way. Within the console, users can create projects to configure data sources, manage verification scope, set disclosure preferences, and define exactly what information will be publicly visible.

Each institution also receives a dedicated **public Explorer page** automatically generated by Primus. This page displays the verified reserves according to the settings defined in the Admin Console, providing end users with a transparent and continuously updated view of the asset holdings.



## Getting Started

Here is the workflow for creating and publishing your Proof-of-Reserves:

**Step1. Create a new project in the Admin Console**

Define your organization identity and configure a showcase URL under the unified domain format 'por.primuslabs.xyz/....'. Each project can specify its own unique path.

**Step 2. Set up your reserve sources and disclose preferences**

In this step, you can add the on-chain and off-chain assets you want to include in your Proof-of-Reserves.

For on-chain reserves, you can manage wallet addresses and token disclosure scopes. Each wallet requires a one-time micro-transaction challenge to verify ownership. 

For off-chain reserves, Primus will provide a customized PoR program based on your data requirements.

You can also optionally configure supply details if you wish to show the reserve-backing ratio, and define alert thresholds to receive email notifications when reserves fall below your desired conditions.

**Step 3. Preview the Explorer page** directly within the Admin Console.

**Step 4. Publish the project** to share your showcase URL with users, auditors, or partners.



## Pricing

Primus PoR product offers a simple and transparent pricing model.

We provide a **7-day free publishing period**, allowing you to create and publish a PoR project at no cost. After the 7-day trial ends, continued public hosting requires a **monthly subscription**.

You can subscribe directly in the Admin Console or contact our team for assistance.



## Technical Highlights

Primus enables off-chain reserve verification with end-to-end cryptographic guarantees by combining zkTLS, TEE, and zkVM-based verifiable computation on a decentralized proving network.

**zkTLS for Authenticated Data Retrieval**

Institutions deploy a custom PoR program in their own environment, where zkTLS is used to retrieve real-time asset balances from off-chain sources such as CEXs.

zkTLS produces a proof that:
- the data is fetched from the legitimate API endpoint
- over a trusted TLS session
- without exposing API credentials or raw account details

This off-chain data source, along with the hashed asset details, is validated by Attestor nodes in the Primus Network and then propagated to the blockchain (Base by default).

**TEE-Assisted Secure Data Processing**

The retrieved off-chain data is additionally processed inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), ensuring:
- data confidentiality throughout computation
- secure communication to the decentralized proving network

The TEE establishes a secure channel to the verifiable computation backend.

**zkVM for Verifiable Aggregation of Reserves**

Through the TEE, the committed data is sent to a zkVM network (e.g., powered by Succinct or other partners), where the PoR program performs:
- grouping by token/asset type
- aggregation of balances into a unified reserve value, which could be disclosed to the public

A zero-knowledge proof is then generated to confirm that the publicly disclosed reserve value is correctly computed from authentic, privately held balances — without revealing any sensitive account-level data.
